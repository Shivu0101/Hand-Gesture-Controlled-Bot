# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Bot
A Hand Gesture Controlled Robot uses sensors like accelerometers &amp; gyroscopes to detect hand movements, allowing control without physical contact. Gestures are captured and sent wirelessly  to a microcontroller on the robot, which interprets the signals to move in desired directions. It's widely used in automation, assistive tech, and robotics.
